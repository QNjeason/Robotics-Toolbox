version 1.1.0.0 (1.65 KB) by Hristo Zhivomirov
An 5D (five dimensions) data visualization using Matlab commands “scatter” and “slice”.

The Matlab code presented here provides a 5D data visualization using Matlab commands “scatter” and “slice” in files five_dim_scatter.m and five_dim_slice.m, respectively.. X, Y and Z coordinates represent the first three dimensions, the fourth dimension is represented via animation, and the fifth dimension is shown with color.
