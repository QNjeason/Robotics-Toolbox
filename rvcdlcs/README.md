# Robotics-Toolbox-Extensions

## Introduction

A extension package for Robotics Toolbox. I add new functions to show the theories I learned from the book: 

[Richard M. Murray, Zexiang Li, S. Shankar Sastry, S. Shankara Sastry - A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation-CRC Press (1994)](https://www.crcpress.com/A-Mathematical-Introduction-to-Robotic-Manipulation/Murray/p/book/9780849379819)

The original toolbox is written by Peter Corke, which can be download at http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox.
